                                        I recently started to play around with C++, primarily for my own personal side
                                        projects and came to find that it is a
                                        really interesting language to learn, especially at this stage of my learning
                                        process. As opposed to interpreted
                                        languages like Ruby and Javascript, C++ is a compiled language. There is a ton
                                        of great information about the
                                        differences between compiled languages vs interpreted languages out there so I
                                        wonâ€™t spend too much time discussing it
                                        in this post. In very basic terms, compiled languages require a compiler vs and
                                        interpreter (sort of self explanatory),
                                        but while they are called different things, their functionality is fairly
                                        similar in that it is responsible for taking
                                        the piece of code you wrote and turning it into something a computer can execute
                                        upon. In the case of C++, and other
                                        'compiled' languages, is that this is a separate process. You must first run the
                                        compiler, and if all goes well, you
                                        will have an executable piece of code.
                                   </p>

                                   <!-- <p>Because of how readily available resources and information on both languages are,
                                        I feel like the learning curve for adapting templates is truly not that steep.

                                        Mainly because a website is a much clearer/cleaner interface than a github

                                        to misrepresent someone else's work as your own, it will most likely come back

                                        Another interesting fact about C++ is that it was one of the first languages to
                                        implement an object-oriented approach to
                                        programming. While there are some key distinctions between the class structure
                                        of Javascript and C++, primarily that
                                        under the hood JS still uses prototypal inheritance, with ES6 some of their
                                        visual structure is similar. The main
                                        difference, however, is that for a class declaration, conventionally you create
                                        two different files. One is a header
                                        that creates the class and declares all of its functions, and then a separate
                                        C++ file that defines all of the 'public'
                                        and 'private' methods for the class. The 'public' are able to be accessed
                                        anywhere in the program, whereas 'private' may
                                        only be accessed within the class. C++ also has a third method type called
                                        'protected' which is similar to that of
                                        'private' methods, but they can be accessed inside of child classes or derived
                                        classes. Similar to ES6 classes, there
                                        are also static methods in C++, which are part of the class definition but not a
                                        part of the object that it creates.

                                   One very odd thing about C++, at least for someone coming from a background of
                                   primarily using languages like
                                   Ruby/Javascript, is that C++ requires that you import libraries to do some of the
                                   most basic functions. For example, you
                                   have to import a standard input/output library called iostream in order to build a
                                   CLI application. C++ is also a
                                   strongly typed language which means, among many others, in any function declaration
                                   you must declare the data-type that
                                   you want said function to return. C++ also deals with manual memory allocation which
                                   is not a concept that I am
                                   currently well versed in, but one that I am very interested in learning about.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                   Essentially it involves understanding the different types of memory you have access
                                   to within a C++ program (heap/stack)
                                   and how the functions in your program take up space. There is also the concepts of
                                   references and pointers which deal
                                   with finding data based on specific memory addresses. In languages like Ruby or
                                   Javascript, all of these issues are
                                   things you will never have to think about while writing your program, but become an
                                   important topic when discussing
                                   scalability of C++ programs.
